This game is based off the child's game cootie.

MyBuddy is a simple game in which a die is rolled.
Each die value corresponds to a different body part of the Buddy being drawn:

1: head 

2: torso 

3: left arm 

4: right arm 

5: left leg 

6: right leg


When the die is rolled if the body part hasn't been drawn then it is added to the drawing.
The player continues to roll the die until they can't draw a new body part.
First player to draw their Buddy wins.
This version of the game is between the player and the AI.
Because no actual strategy isinvolved when the game starts it automatically plays out.
